# VitalAlert

This project aims to predict vital signs, such as heart rate and oxygen levels, over the next 5 minutes, as well as the probability of mortality. By doing so, it seeks to identify moments when a patient may be in danger. To achieve this, we will utilize a Time Series prediction model applied to data that is organized chronologically.
The data will be used from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database, which is a collection of data about various patients, mainly physiological monitoring data such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and information about patient outputs such as urine, drainage, etc. that can be obtained through outputevents.
